** This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern 
** This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

How to implement this?

Step 1

Create a Singleton Class. 
hint : (SingleObject class have its constructor as private and have a static instance of itself.)
	   (SingleObject class provides a static method to get its static instance to outside world.)

Step 2
Get the only object from the singleton class.
